    <div class="aboutme">
    <p>My name is Anthony but feel free to call me "Tony". I am an Electrical Engineer
     who's looking to add skills in web application development. I currently work as an Application
     Engineer where i've supported hardware and software.  This experience has allowed me to understand 
     the benefit of having the potential to create we applications to simplify or increase efficiency of certain tasks.
     My hope to to create two web applications in my current role while potentially creating new products of my own interest.</p>
